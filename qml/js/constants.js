"<p>So why are there no fart apps on MeeGo? "+
"<p><p><br>Isn't the <b>mobile revolution</b> all about fart apps and connecting them to Foursquare to report things like \”I just farted at McDonalds near Time Square with 4 other people\”?? " +
"<p><p><br>It's actually pretty simple: the mobile revolution is not about fart apps. It's not even about apps, it's about you doing stuff while on the run. "+
"<p>Also, the MeeGo users are too intelligent to care for such things. "+
"In fact, the only time the intelligent MeeGo folks would care for a fart is when is a brain fart. So this app is a brain-fart app. "+
"<p>Have fun! And remember... your platform is burning so be careful where you put it."
